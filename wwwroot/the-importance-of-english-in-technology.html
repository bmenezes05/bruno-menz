                        <h2>The Importance of English in Technology – and How It Changed My Life</h2>

                        <p>Let’s talk about something essential in the tech industry: English. Yes, it might sound like a cliché, but the truth is, mastering this language can change your career. I’ll share a bit of my personal experience and show you how English can be your greatest asset—or your biggest obstacle.</p>

                        <h2>The Journey Begins with Music and Video Games</h2>
                        <p>
                            I started learning English in a rather unconventional way. As a rock ‘n roll fan, I wanted to understand what the band members were singing. So, there I was, deciphering song lyrics, trying to grasp the meaning of each verse. Another motivator? Video games! I’ve always been passionate about games with complex stories, and if I wanted to understand the plot, I had to figure out the English. Playing RPGs or adventure games without translations was like reading a book in another language: you learn through the effort, word by word.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so, I became a self-taught English speaker. It wasn’t something I planned, but it turned into a vital skill for me, and I’ll tell you why.</p>

                        <h2>
                            English Opens Doors
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            As the years went by, I ended up being awarded a full government scholarship to study computer science at the Institute of Technology of Indiana, also known as Indiana Tech, in the United States. I spent a year there, immersed in the academic and cultural environment. And I can guarantee: this experience was a turning point. English not only allowed me to follow the classes and interact with peers, but it also opened doors to opportunities I never would have imagined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After that experience, I started getting international jobs, meeting with tech vendors, and even collaborating with giant companies in cloud and database technologies. Suddenly, the world became smaller and more accessible, all because I was proficient in English. It’s no exaggeration to say that this skill was crucial in getting me to where I am today.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How English Can Transform Your Tech Career</h2>
                        <p>Now, setting aside my personal story, let’s talk about how English can transform your career too. In the tech world, the language is the bridge that connects you to global knowledge. A large portion of technical documentation, tutorials, videos, forums, and communities is in English. Programming languages, commands, and even the errors that appear in your console are written in this language. So, having a solid foundation in English means you won’t depend on translations or adaptations to learn something new—you’ll always be one step ahead.</p>
                        <p>Imagine you’re trying to solve a complex problem. If you speak English, you go straight to Stack Overflow, GitHub, or any official documentation and find the answer. But if you don’t understand the language well, you might waste valuable time trying to decipher an automatic translation or something that hasn’t even been documented in your native language yet. And that lost time could be the difference between delivering a project on time or having to explain to the client why things got delayed.</p>

                        <h2>Why English Is a Differentiator in the Job Market</h2>
                        <p>Being fluent in English not only helps you work faster and more efficiently, but it also makes you stand out in the job market. Global companies look for people who can communicate well with teams around the world. Even within startups or national companies, being fluent in English could be the key to applying for more interesting projects or even leading negotiations with international partners.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, many of the most coveted jobs require at least an intermediate level of English. Without this skill, you might end up limited to smaller roles or companies that don’t have such requirements—and, let’s be honest, those aren’t usually the most innovative.</p>

                        <h2>The Disadvantages of Not Having English in the Tech World</h2>
                        <p>On the other hand, not having a good understanding of English can severely limit your career. Without it, you miss out on the vast amount of knowledge available only in English. Plus, your growth opportunities will be much more restricted. Imagine being in an important meeting and not understanding what an international client is saying, or being left out of a crucial technical discussion because you don’t speak the language. That can be frustrating and hurt your professional confidence.</p>
                        <p>And the problem goes beyond opportunities: not knowing English can hinder your continuous learning. After all, most advanced courses and new technological developments are first released in English. If you don’t keep up, you could fall behind.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            English is the universal language of technology. Learning and mastering this language may seem difficult at first, but the benefits are immense. And, as I showed with my own experience, English can literally transform your career. From deciphering song lyrics and game stories to studying in the United States and working with major international companies—English was the key differentiator in my journey.
                            So, if you’re still unsure about the importance of English, the advice is simple: start as soon as possible! Whether through music, TV shows, games, or formal courses, the important thing is to get familiar with the language. You’ll see that, in the tech field, this skill can be the factor that takes your career to the next level.
